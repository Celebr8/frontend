      <h2>Services Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        This Whichost Services Agreement (“Agreement”) is a contract between Whichost Ltd. (“Whichost” or “we”) and the person(s) that are registered with Whichost (“user” or “you”). This Agreement describes the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Whichost marketplace to book or list pubs or other pub services through our website or apps, and governs your pub for other users, and establishes the obligations owed between you and Whichost, and between you and other users.
		</p>
		<p>
Throughout this Agreement, the term “Service” means the service allowing you to book pubs or offer your pub and pub services to others through our website or apps (the “Platform”). The term Service does not include any services provided by third parties. The terms “Customer” and “Pub” refer to the party Booking or Listing a Pub, respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
A “Pub” is the physical space or pub that is made available to a Customer to use during specific times, and subject to specific Fees and any site-specific terms or limitations. A Pub may “List” a Pub by providing certain details about the Pub including availability, pricing, and terms or limitations of use; this posting about a Pub is called a “Listing.”
		</p>
		<p>
A customer may “Book” a Pub by accepting the times, fees, and any additional terms (such as fees for Additional Engineering Services) or limitations of the Listing. A “Booking” is (i) only the grant of a limited, temporary, revocable license to use a Pub, and (ii) if applicable, a contract for Pub Services, in the manner, for the time, and subject to all restrictions provided, subject to this Agreement, and as confirmed through the Platform. The scope of the use, including times, specific fees, and other additional terms or limitations, constitutes a “Booking Agreement” that incorporates the terms and conditions of this Agreement and referenced policies. A Booking does not provide you with a lease but only allows you limited access to use the Pub or other services only as permitted in the Agreement and, as applicable, the Booking Agreement.

Please read this section carefully before accepting this Agreement—you may not use the Platform or Services if you do not agree to this section.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
<strong>(a) Process for Arbitration</strong>. Subject to the exclusions provided in Part 4.2(b) and the process provided in Part 4.3, all disputes, claims, and controversies arising under or related to this Agreement between you and Whichost or between you and another user (if not resolved pursuant to Part 4.3 below) will be resolved through binding arbitration as follows:
		</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>(i) if the amount of the dispute, claim, or controversy is reasonably less than €25,000, resolution shall be administered online by an online arbitration provider of our choosing in accordance with their applicable arbitration rules and procedures effective at the time a claim is made. You consent to receive electronic service of process at the email associated with your Account. Where you are delinquent in responding to such process, you will be responsible for any attorney, court, or other fees associated with the delinquency. The party filing the User Dispute will be responsible for payment of any costs associated with that filing, including costs borne by Whichost. As a part of the User Dispute, you may also seek to recover these costs if you prevail.</li>
			<li>(ii) if the amount of the dispute, claim or controversy is reasonably €25,000 or more, resolution shall be before a single arbitrator and administered by JAMS International. This includes but is not limited to any statutory or common law claims relating to breach, enforcement, or interpretation of this Agreement and any Booking Agreement. Any such arbitration will take place in the county where the Booked or Listed Pub is located, unless you and Whichost mutually agree otherwise. The arbitrator will apply the substantive Laws of Ireland. All claims from €25,000 to €250,000 shall be subject to the JAMS International Streamlined Arbitration Rules. To initiate such an arbitration, a party will provide a written demand that states both the basis of the claim and the desired relief. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process through personal service at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary address (for individuals or sole proprietors). Nothing in this Agreement affects the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		Once arbitration is initiated as provided in Subparts (i) or (ii) above, the parties will share the costs of the arbitration, facilities, and arbitration reporters (as necessary) equally except as otherwise determined by the arbitrator. Each party will be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and legal costs. The arbitrator may award the prevailing party recovery of any of the costs of arbitration or legal fees as they see appropriate.
		</p>
		<p>
The arbitrator may provide for any monetary or other remedies that are available under applicable Law but may not modify the terms of this Agreement or any Booking Agreement. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned decision addressing the specifics of the dispute. The decision is binding and not subject to appeal. The parties will act promptly to respect the decision of the arbitrator, including payment of any amounts owed or taking of any action required.
		</p>
		<p>
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
		</p>
		<p>
<strong>(b) Certain Claims Excluded</strong>.

Upon review and investigation, we will either (a) provide you and the other user our conclusion based on the summary provided, which you agree to accept as final and binding determination with the same force and effect as if determined through arbitration as provided in Part 4.2; or (b) require that the dispute is resolved through binding arbitration adjudicated by a third party as provided in Part 4.2(a). The party filing the User Dispute will be responsible for payment of any costs associated with that filing, including costs borne by Whichost. As a part of the User Dispute, you may also seek to recover these costs if you prevail. Any payments held by Whichost pending final resolution of a User Dispute shall be disbursed by Whichost as determined by Whichost, the arbitrator, or a court of competent jurisdiction.
