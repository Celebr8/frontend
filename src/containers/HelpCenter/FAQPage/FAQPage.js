                We understand that for the longest time most parties have been booked without any
                upfront payment. However, the users' behaviour is changing and more and more they
                are getting used to having to pay upfront for all types of bookings. Charging
                upfront for users to requesting a booking at your business makes them have skin on
                the game, which will significantly reduce the probability of a no-show. As an idea,
                you can always tell your customers that the money they pay for the booking will be
                used as credit for their receipt.

              <p>
                In cases where you charge a booking fee depending on group size, we recommend you
                having different listings since you can limit the number of people who can attend
                and the price per hour, per listing.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, in one listing you set the limit of the group size to the maximum number of
                people where the booking fee is a set price. To give you an idea, let's say for
                example that you usually charge a booking fee if the group size is more than 20
                people. In this first listing, you set the maximum group size limit to 20. Up to 20
                people, you will charge a minimum amount for the booking.
              </p>
              <p>
                {' '}
                In the second listing, you set the minimum group size to 21 (because this is where
                you start charging a different price for the booking) and the maximum depending on
                how many people you can receive. Let's say for example your pub can receive 50
                people. So in this second listing, the group size limits are a minimum of 20 and a
                maximum of 50 people, and in this listing you set up a different booking fee.

                When listing your pub you first will be prompted to choose one of the two listing
                types. Here are the main differences between them:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Common Spaces</li>
                <p>
                  This is the most common listing type. A common space is where you can have more
                  than one booking at the same time. Usually, common spaces are the common areas of
                  your pub.
                </p>
                <p>With this type of listing:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You can set up a price per night</li>
                  <li>the calendar is available and</li>
                  <li>- reviews are available.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  When a customer requests a booking in your common space it's important for you to
                  keep an eye on the number of people coming, and the parties that you have already
                  accepted for the day requested. Setting up a price will reduce the number of
                  no-shows in your pub and increase the quality of customers. The minimum price you
                  can set up, regardless if you go with per night or per person, is €9.00. We always
                  recommend you indicating to your customers, in the description of your listing,
                  that the payment will be used as credit for their tab since this is a common
                  practice and most customers will expect that. You can list more than one common
                  space if you need to.
                </p>
                <li>Private Spaces</li>
                <p>
                  This listing type is for those spaces in your pub that customers can book to have
                  private parties. As the name indicates, they are private spaces so as soon as a
                  customer books it, that space will only available for that party and for that
                  period of time.
                </p>
                <p>With this type of listing:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>you can set up a price per night</li>
                  <li>the calendar is activated and</li>
                  <li>- reviews are available.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  You can clearly indicate the days of the week and times in which your private
                  space is available. As a customer requests a booking in your private space and you
                  confirm the booking, that night (or those hours) will be reserved, so no other
                  customer will be able to make a booking request for the same date and times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Setting up a price will reduce the number of no-shows in your pub and increase the
                  quality of customers. The minimum price you can set up, regardless if you go with
                  per night or per hour, is €9.00. We always recommend you indicating to your
                  customers, in the description of your listing, that the payment will be used as
                  credit for their tab since this a common practice and most customers will expect
                  that.
                </p>

                Celebr8 is a fresh and self-funded startup. Instead of starting a venture-backed
                startup that focuses on vanity metrics, revenue at all costs, and expectations of
                investors, we’ve chosen to keep Celebr8 a self-funded company. We’ve raised € 0.00
                to date and this is something that we're incredibly proud of. We would rather build
                a platform that is so valuable that the community is willing to pay for Celebr8, we
                can reinvest revenue in the site, and we commit ourselves to building the best
                online community for pubs in the world.

                Trust between pubs and customers is essential. One way to build trust is with rates
                and comments to each other, after a transaction. This is how trust is built with
                Celebr8. After a booking is used, both the pub and the customer can review each
                other. A review consists of:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>A positive or negative rating (thumbs up or down);</li>
                <li>A free-form text comment.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                If you want you can choose not to review the customer. However, you can't refuse a
                review from the customer after a used booking. Reviews are visible to everyone on
                each user's profile page. A pub’s rating (percentage of positive ratings and number
                of ratings) is also shown on each listing page.

                “Request to book”. On the next page, you will be able to enter a message to the pub
                regarding how you intend to use it, any specific details, requirements, or needs
                regarding the booking request. You can enter your payment information and send the

                eencourage you to immediately notify the pub using our messaging. Each pub listing
                enforces their own cancellation policy identified on their listing, so please keep
                this in mind prior to submitting a booking request. If you require assistance with a

                You can send multiple requests, but we strongly recommend that you wait to hear back
                from a pub once you send a request. If the request is urgent, you can contact the
                pubs over the "Contact" button on the listing page underneath the title of the pub.
              </p>
              <p>
                By contacting the pub over the "Contact" button, you can contact as many pubs as you
                wish and you don't have to worry that you will end up with more than one booking,
                since you're sending "just" contact inquiries and not booking requests.

              <p>
                Trust between customers and pubs is very important. One way to build trust is with
                rates and comments to each other, after a transaction. This is how trust is built
                with Celebr8. After a booking is used, both the customer and the pub can review each
                other. A review consists of:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>A positive or negative rating (thumbs up or down);</li>
                <li>A free-form text comment.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                If you want you can choose not to review the pub. However, you can't refuse a review
                from the pub after a used booking. Reviews are visible to everyone on each user's
                profile page. As a side note, a pub’s rating (percentage of positive ratings and
                number of ratings) is also shown on each listing page.
              </p>
